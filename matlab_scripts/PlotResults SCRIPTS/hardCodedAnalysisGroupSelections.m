% To USE, need to assign to an analysisGroup object.
%    1) Create new analysisGroup object
%       e.g. analysisGroupSummer2022 = AnalysisGroupObj("duration training");)
%    2) Execute definition of file group variable of interest below
%       e.g.  fileNames = ceilTraining
%    3) Assign file group to analysisGroup
%       e.g. analysisGroupSummer2022.defineFileGroup("someFileGroupNameString",fileNames);
